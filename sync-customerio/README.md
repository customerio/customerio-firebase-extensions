# Sync contacts with Customer.io

**Author**: Customer.io (**[https://customer.io](https://customer.io)**)

**Description**: Sync customer data from Firebase Authentication and Firestore collections to Customer.io and send transactional and marketing emails, push notifications, SMS and more.



**Details**: Customer.io allows you to utilize the data about your users to send personalized messages to them over different channels.

This extension allows you to sync your users to your Customer.io account.
Users can be managed by Firebase Authentication and any time users are creted or deleted those changes will be synced with your Customer.io.
Alternatively you can specify a Firestore collection to monitor where user records are stored and those changes can also be synced.

For user profiles created from Firebase Authentication the extension will sync the following data if available:
- id
- email
- phone
- email_verified
- display_name
- photo_url
- disabled
- created_at
- last_sign_in

With using a Firestore collection you have more control on how profiles are identified and the data to be synced.
Example user document
```json
{
	"identifiers": {
		"id": "db01",
	},
	"attributes": {
		"first_name": "John",
		"last_name": "Doe",
		"email": "john.doe@example.com",
		"plan": "basic"
	}
}
```
Alternatively we also support email as an identifier
```json
{
	"identifiers": {
		"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
	},
	"attributes": {
		"first_name": "Jane",
		"last_name": "Doe",
		"plan": "premiun",
		"created_at": 1361205308
	}
}
```

The extension looks for two fields in document structure:

    **name:** `identifiers`
    **description:** The person you want to perform an action on.
    **type:** Object
        - must provide one of either id or email
        - you cannot pass multiple identifiers
    **notes:** Optional field however highly recomended to include otherwise the document id will be used as the identifier.

    **name:** `attributes`
    **description:** Attributes that you want to add or update for this person.
    **type:** Object
    **notes:** Optional field however if missing only the data that would be synced in the document id as the identifier.

    Example document since `identifiers` is missing the document id will implictly used
    ```json
    # /users/db01
    {
      "attributes": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "plan": "basic"
      }
    }
    ```

    Example document that overrides the identifier

    ```json
    # /users/db01
    {
      "identifiers": {
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      },
      "attributes": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "plan": "basic"
      }
    }
    ```
