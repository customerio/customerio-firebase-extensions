    **type:** Object
        - must provide one of either id or email
        - you cannot pass multiple identifiers
    **notes:** Optional field; document id will be used as the identifier if nothing else is specified.

    **name:** `attributes`
    **description:** Attributes that you want to add or update for this person.
    **type:** Object
    **notes:** Optional field

    Example document if `identifiers` isn't included.

    {
      "attributes": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "plan": "basic"
      }
