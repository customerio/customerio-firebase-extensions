Customer.io allows you to utilize the data about your users to send personalized messages to them over different channels.

This extension allows you to sync your users to your Customer.io account.
Users can be managed by Firebase Authentication and any time users are creted or deleted those changes will be synced with your Customer.io.
Alternatively you can specify a Firestore collection to monitor where user records are stored and those changes can also be synced.

For user profiles created from Firebase Authentication the extension will sync the following data if available:
- id
- email
- phone
- email_verified
- display_name
- photo_url
- disabled
- created_at
- last_sign_in

With using a Firestore collection you have more control on how profiles are identified and the data to be synced.
Example user document
```json
{
	"identifiers": {
		"id": "db01",
	},
	"attributes": {
		"first_name": "John",
		"last_name": "Doe",
		"email": "john.doe@example.com",
		"plan": "basic"
	}
}
```
Alternatively we also support email as an identifier
```json
{
	"identifiers": {
		"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
	},
	"attributes": {
		"first_name": "Jane",
		"last_name": "Doe",
		"plan": "premiun",
		"created_at": 1361205308
	}
}
```
